# nisaba

This library brings a disciplined structure to data reconciliation, providing deterministic conflict resolution, data validation and quality checks, clean merging primitives, and a trustworthy source of truth—so engineers can focus on building systems, not untangling inconsistent or unreliable records.

## Naming

In Mesopotamian/Sumeria mythology, [Nisaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisaba) is the goddess of writing, accounting, and the orderly keeping of records, entrusted with maintaining clarity across ledgers and knowledge archives.

## Getting started
Prefer using the example and [the generated docs](https://docs.rs/nisaba)


## Roadmap
See the [roadmap](./docs/ROADMAP.md) for future plans

## Versioning

As with most Rust crates, this library is versioned according to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). [Breaking changes] will only
be made with good reason, and as infrequently as is feasible. Such
changes will generally be made in releases where the major version
number is increased (note [Cargo's caveat for pre-1.x
versions][caveat]), although [limited exceptions may occur][exceptions].
Increases in the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) are not
considered breaking, but will result in a minor version bump.

See also [the changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for details about changes in
recent versions.
